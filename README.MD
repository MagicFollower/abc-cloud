#### 🔍The meaning of MicroService (why we need microservice)?
1. [seperated config file]
2. [integrated with system (deeply)]

try to think about this environment: integrated one of [MQ product] in system that has many business-modules.

[microservice] will be a helper, we don't need to inject many [same-config-properties] in different modules! (Absolutely! you also can use some configCenter like Apollo😄)

on the other hand, [microservice] will help us abstract some upper APIs that concerned about our business-module and not use-raw-apis anywhere!
